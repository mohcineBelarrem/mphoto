# mphoto

This is the result of my assignment :

It's an app that shows Albums, Photos and photo details based from this data :

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohcineBelarrem/photosdb/master/db.json

Here's a demo of the app working :

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true">
    <source src="assets/record.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</figure>
